# Rule-Based Recommendation and Study Plan System

## Overview

This document describes the rule-based fallback system for the Node.js quiz application that provides intelligent recommendations and study plans when AI services (DeepSeek and Gemini) are unavailable or fail.

## Architecture

The system consists of two main components:

1. **Rule-Based Recommendations Service** (`lib/rule-based-recommendations-service.ts`)
2. **Rule-Based Study Plan Service** (`lib/rule-based-study-plan-service.ts`)

Both services integrate seamlessly with the existing AI-powered systems and provide intelligent fallbacks.

## Features

- **Beginner Level** (< 40%): Focus on foundational concepts and building confidence
- **Intermediate Level** (40-70%): Focus on practice and concept integration
- **Advanced Level** (> 70%): Focus on advanced applications and mastery

### ðŸ“š Recommendation Types
- **Course-Specific**: Tailored to individual course performance
- **General**: Based on overall user profile and quiz history
- **Filtered**: By program, year, and semester
- **Weak Area Focused**: Targeting specific knowledge gaps
- **Strong Area Enhancement**: Building on existing strengths

### ðŸ“– Study Plan Features
- **Personalized Advice**: Based on performance level
- **Time Allocation**: Optimized study time distribution

## API Integration

### Recommendations API (`/api/deepseek-recommendations`)

The API automatically falls back to rule-based recommendations when:
- DeepSeek API key is not configured
- DeepSeek API fails (rate limits, quota exceeded, network issues)
- DeepSeek API returns errors

**Request Example:**
```json
{
  "quizResults": [
    {
      "quizId": "quiz-1",
      "courseId": "cs101",
      "score": 6,
      "total": 10,
      "strengths": ["variables", "basic syntax"],
